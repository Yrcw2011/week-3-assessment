		<h1>About</h1>
        <p1>   Mitchell Marsh "age", older than you. I was born and raised til I was 15yrs old in Seattle, Washington
			I moved to Utah in the middle of my sophmore year of High School.  In 2010, I purchased  
			BitCoin for just .09 cents each with less than $200 US dollars. I still have 1500 of them today. I use this and other investments 
			to aid in my mission to save animals. </p1>  
           <p2>
			I have been caring for lost, abandoned or abused animals for more then 20 years
			It has been my mission to rescue as many animals that have been mistreated and 
			seeing to their mental and health welfare.  </p2>
		<p3>
			But most importantly to help each animal find their forever home with a family that 
			will love and care for them!
		</p3>
		<p4>
		   I am currtently taking classes on Coding. It has been a "life-time dream of mine" to code and write 
			software.  But none of this takes presidence over my organization "Paws 4 life". For which, I founded 11 years ago!!!
